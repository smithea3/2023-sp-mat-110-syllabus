  <title>No Show Date/Census Date Policy</title>
  <p>
    In order to remain enrolled in a course, a student must attend class on or before the class census date. If a student does not attend class by the census date, they will be reported as a “no show” (NS) by the instructor and will be automatically withdrawn from the course.  To ensure students attend class and avoid being marked as a “no show”, students need to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>
      For traditional 100% seated classes, a student must be physically present in class on or before the class census date
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For blended or hybrid classes, a student must either complete the Mandatory Course Enrollment Activity (MCEA) in the LMS or be physically be present in class on or before the class census date
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For 100% online classes, a student must complete the MCEA in the LMS on or before the class census date.
      </p>
    </li>      
  </ul>

  <p>
    If a student does not meet the census date requirement, the student must be reported as a no-show for the class. Students reported as a “no-show” are withdrawn from the class.  The no show date and the census date are the same date for a course and can be found on the course syllabus as well as on the <url href="https://mitchellcc.edu/office-student-records">Office of Student Records webpage</url> (link opens in a new window). For blended, hybrid, and online courses this date is also noted in the MCEA.
