  <title>Attendance Policy</title>
  <p>
    Mitchell Community College is an attendance taking institution. Instructors in all curriculum courses are required to report student attendance. Attendance begins on the first scheduled day of a course, even for students who register late. Mitchell Community College recognizes the connection between student attendance and student retention, achievement and success. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, clinical experiences, and laboratory periods for which they are enrolled. Absence from any of these learning experiences, regardless of cause, reduces the opportunity for learning and may adversely affect a student’s achievement.

  <p>
    Students are responsible for class attendance and for any class work missed during an absence. The instructor’s policy on make-up work must be clearly stated in the class syllabus. Obtaining and making up missed work is the student’s responsibility.

  <p>
    When a student fails to comply with the attendance policy of the class or fails to attend for two consecutive weeks (14 calendar days), the instructor should process an administrative withdrawal for the student resulting in a grade of W (See Withdrawal Policy below).
