  <title>Withdrawal Policy</title>
  <p>
  The last day a student can withdraw from a course or from all courses with a grade of “W” is at the 75 percent point of the course. The exact date is published on the <url href="https://mitchellcc.edu/academic-resources-0">Academic Calendar</url> (link opens in new window).  After the 75 percent point of the course, the student can no longer initiate a withdrawal and will receive the grade earned in the course at the end of the term.  Students can locate withdrawal information by visiting the Office of Student Records webpage.  If the student needs to drop a class they can click on the Drop/Add Procedure menu link.  If they need to withdraw from all of their classes they can click on the “<url href="https://mitchellcc.edu/withdrawal-procedure">Withdrawal Procedure</url>” menu link (links opens in new window).
